This repository is part of an assignment from Full Stack Open course part CI/CD. The actual app is Country Inf oApp that has been modified by making a very simple backend, adding some tests with jest and cypress. The idea is  to practice making pipelines and automate the deployment with github actions and fly.io.


This React.js app lists info of countries.
Maker: Juho Simojoki
